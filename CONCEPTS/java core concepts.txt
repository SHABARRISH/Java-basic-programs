---

### **1. Basics of Java Programming**
- **Syntax**: Understanding Java syntax and structure.
- **Data Types**: int, float, char, boolean, etc.
- **Control Statements**: if, if-else, switch-case.
- **Loops**: for, while, do-while.
- **Arrays**: Single and multi-dimensional arrays.

---

### **2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**
- **Classes and Objects**: Basics of creating and using classes and objects.
- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding and access modifiers.
- **Inheritance**: Reusability of code.
- **Polymorphism**: Overloading and overriding methods.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces.

---

### **3. Collections Framework**
- **ArrayList**, **LinkedList**, **HashMap**, **HashSet**, and **TreeSet**: To handle and manipulate data efficiently.
- **Iterators**: For traversing through collections.
- **Streams**: For functional programming and data processing.

---

### **4. Exception Handling**
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Handling runtime errors.
- **Finally Block**: Ensuring code execution.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Creating user-defined exceptions.

---

### **5. String Manipulation**
- String methods: length(), substring(), charAt(), equals(), compareTo(), etc.
- StringBuilder and StringBuffer: Efficient string manipulation.

---

### **6. Recursion**
- Solving problems using recursive methods (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, and backtracking problems).

---

### **7. Algorithms and Data Structures in Java**
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear search, binary search.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort.
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees (Binary Tree, BST).

---

### **8. Java 8+ Features**
- **Lambda Expressions**: Writing concise code.
- **Streams API**: Processing collections and arrays efficiently.
- **Functional Interfaces**: Predicate, Function, Supplier, Consumer.

---

### **9. File Handling**
- Reading and writing to files using FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter.
- Serialization and Deserialization.

---

### **10. Multithreading and Concurrency**
- **Threads**: Creating and managing threads.
- **Synchronization**: Ensuring thread safety.
- **Executor Framework**: Managing thread pools.

---

### **11. Problem Solving with Algorithms**
- Implementing problems like:
  - **Two Sum**
  - **Palindrome Checking**
  - **Anagrams**
  - **Matrix Operations**

---

### **12. Design Patterns**
- **Singleton**: Ensuring a single instance.
- **Factory**: Object creation patterns.
- **Observer**: Event-driven programming.

---

### **13. Debugging and Code Optimization**
- Using breakpoints, debugging tools, and code profiling.
- Identifying and fixing logical errors.
